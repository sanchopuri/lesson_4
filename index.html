		<h1>The World's 5 Most Beautiful Places (A Scientific Study)</h1>
		<div class="top">
			<p>There are plenty of <a class="link" href=""> lists of the world’s most beautiful places—but they’re usually subjective.</a> Britain-based travel company Kuoni recently put science to work to make an official ranking of the world’s most beautiful travel destinations. The company’s eye-tracking study analyzed the world’s most well-known natural wonders. The goal: to rank the locations that are most attractive to the human eye, thereby qualifying them as the most beautiful travel destinations in the world.</p>
			<br> <p>In the scientific study, participants viewed a series of images from 50 of the world’s most famous natural landmarks, from the Grand Canyon to the Maldives. The participants’ eye movements were tracked using AI technology, showing which images captured the eye the longest. This eye-catching data was then analyzed to reveal the world’s most beautiful places.</p>

The second most beautiful place in the world is Meeru Island in the Maldives, which captivates travelers with its white sands and tropical blue waters.</p>
			<br> <p>Other destinations topping the list include the Jurassic Coast in the U.K., Yosemite and New Zealand’s Lake Tekapo. Read on to see the full list of the most beautiful places around the world.</p> <br>
